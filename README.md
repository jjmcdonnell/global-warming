Herein lies the repo for as disucssed in the video above! As noted, it is a very wide spanning, evolving complex area of study. I am not denying that recorded data has showed and upward growth slope - however we've had significantly greater rates of change and are showing rates of change similar on planets without human activity.  I do strongly believe we should strive to make the best innovations we can and that innovations should seek to minimize the impact of our effect on the globe in all regards. This is a broad, evolving, and complex field of study. I acknowledge that recorded data has shown an upward trend, but it’s worth noting that we’ve observed even greater rates of change, and similar rates of change on planets devoid of human activity.  I do strongly believe we should strive to make the best innovations we can with considerations that seek to minimize the negative impacts they have in all manners possible.  The point of this repo and video series is really to explore whether or not these changes are adequately being proven to certain attributions. Hopefully it can through debate/review lead to further evolution of the science, mathematical processes, proper and adequate documentation, change logging, etc.
